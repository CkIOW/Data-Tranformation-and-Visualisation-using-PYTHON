## Data Transformation and Visualization using Python

This repository provides Python scripts for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing raw datasets as a preliminary step before fitting machine learning models. The scripts include data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, as well as transformation methods to prepare the data for analysis. Visualizations generated help in identifying outliers and understanding relationships between variables, aiding in feature selection and model building. 

### Key Features:
- Data cleaning techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Transformation methods to prepare data for analysis and model fitting.
- Visualizations to identify outliers and explore variable relationships.
- Essential preprocessing steps before fitting machine learning models.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Run the Python scripts in the scripts directory to clean, transform, and visualize your dataset.

### Dependencies:
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
